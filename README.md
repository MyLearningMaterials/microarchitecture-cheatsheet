Microarchitecture cheat sheet is about X86 CPU topics for developers and mainly oriented towards performance.

It divides that huge subject into following realms :
	
	Pipeline realm 
	Arithmetic realm 
	Branch prediction realm 
	
	Load store realm 
	Cache memory realm 
	System memory realm 
	Virtual memory realm 
	
	Multicore realm 
	MultiCPU realm 
	
	"About all realms" realm

Feedbacks : I do not claim that every information is exact. Somw of them are topics I had the chance to get my hands on during projects, but some are not based on project experiences but studies out of curiosity.
In case you find an issue, you can either raise a PR publicly or you can mail me. My mail address is in the poster.
